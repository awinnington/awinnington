### Hi there üëã

I have been a Network Engineer and Architect since 1994. I have been a Security Engineer and Architect since 1999. I have been programming on and off since the Commodore 64 was a thing.  In 2018 I decided that the future of Information Security is not going to be on the wire but in the application, and I started Clouds2Code to do two things:

- Bridge the gap between packets and applications by making application data easier for network devices to consume.
- Build better networks and applications by removing the toil from operating a network.
 
Most of my projects are private; I will make them open if I can. I will share my presentations here, and I will also link to documents or articles was quoted in or write.
